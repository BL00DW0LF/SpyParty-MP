SpyParty-M=P
============
This is a quick and simple Android Application for the Missions=Points variant of SpyParty

ToDo:
Finish handling what to do when removing an error in history
    -update score (partially done)
    -figure out who's spy (only allowing removal of most recent entry, makes all this easier)
    -figure out if we switch next round
Need the ability to reset
    -re-enable the two "player name" boxes and "first spy" toggle
