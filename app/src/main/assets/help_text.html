<p>Missions=Points is generally played as follows:</p>
<p>The first Spy chooses a map.  The mission set is Known X (Spy's choice.  Any X of All may be used too).</p>
<p>Once both players have played the map once as each role, the new spy will choose a map.</p>
<p>Note that this means players will play back-to-back games as Spy or Sniper, but each game occurs on a different map (unless a player selected the same map).</p>
<p>The Spy will receive points for each mission completed (choose ahead of time if you want the Spy to survive for 10 seconds after each completion).</p>
<p>If the Sniper shoots incorrectly, the Spy will receive full points.</p>
