    <string name="help_info">The Missions=Points is generally played as follows:\n
            The first Spy chooses a map.  The mission set is Known X (Spy\'s choice.  Any X of All may be used too).\n
            Once both players have played the map once as each role, the new spy will choose a map.\n
            Note that this means players will play back-to-back games as Spy or Sniper, but each game occurs on a different map (unless a player selected the same map).\n
            \n
            The Spy will receive points for each mission completed (choose ahead of time if you want the Spy to survive for 10 seconds after each completion).\n
            If the Sniper shoots incorrectly, the Spy will receive full points.\n
            \n\n
